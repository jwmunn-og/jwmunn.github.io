### Hey, I’m Justin

I’m currently pushing code at Microsoft and living in Seattle, WA.

I spend as much time outside as possible hiking, camping and have a bit of a snowboarding problem. Currently going through the Basic Alpine Climbing course through [The Mountaineers](https://www.mountaineers.org/) with my wife.

In June 2017, I graduated from [The&nbsp;Firehose&nbsp;Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com) coding bootcamp, where I apprenticed building full-stack web apps using ruby and javascript. Aftwerwards, they hired me as part-time technical support: answering student questions, debuggin rails apps, and contributed to the curriculumn source code.

I remain the front-end developer maintaining a side project: [DonaldDonates.com](https://donalddonates.com)

### Background

I'm a born and bred Carolinan, in both South and North Carolina respectively. While living in Raleigh I became a proud husband and uncle.

From June 2014 to Jan 2018, I worked remotely full-time and followed my wife's nursing contracts around the US. During that time we moved every 4 months living from Delaware to Alaska and many places in between.

In January 2018 we decided to settle in Seattle, WA with our cat and dog.
